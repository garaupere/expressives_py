expressives_py is a Python script created to detect expressives in oral corpus. This is a suplementary script to expressives_praat.praat script, created to extract acoustic values from annotated corpora.
expressives_py can be used to prepare the data resulting from expressives_praat.praat script. Also implements features to calcule speech rate based on words per minute and identifying seven types of expressives (following Dols, 2020 in press) by text processing.
This software has to be understood as part of a project working on expressives in Catalan corpora.
